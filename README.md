# Strada

**Note:** The Hotwire frameworks are presented in beta form. We're using them all in production with HEY, but expect that significant changes might be made in response to early feedback. ✌️❤️

Strada is a light-weight library that provides a bridge for bi-directional, async communication between a native [iOS](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-ios)/Android app and a [web app](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-web) embedded in a web view. The bridge allows sending/receiving messages with a standard format.
