# Build Bridge Components

## Your first component

After you set up your app in the [Quick Start](QUICK-START.md) guide, it's time to build your first native component. Native components receive messages from corresponding web components of the same name. So, be sure to understand how [web components](https://strada.hotwired.dev/handbook/web) work in your web app and start there.
